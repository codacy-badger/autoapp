# Setting Up Continuous Integration

In this section we'll be finishing the CI flow, I say `finishing` because we've already configured [Quay](https://quay.io) to pull and build on any new tag on our [remote repo](https://github.com/derekahn/autoapp/pulls) so that's the second half. This will be the first half in which runs our `Go` tests and tests the üê≥ build on a pre-merge.

So there's some redundancy happening but I think is important and good if your mantra is `DON'T BREAK THE BUILD!`
